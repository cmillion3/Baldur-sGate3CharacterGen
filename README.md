# Baldur's Gate 3 Character Generator

## Overview
This is an early alpha version of a **Baldur's Gate 3 Character Generator**. The generator creates fully randomized characters, including:
- Race
- Class
- Background
- Personality Traits
- Likes
- Appearance Details

Additionally, the program includes a feature to generate a backstory using a local **LLM**. However, users must manually set up **Ollama**(https://ollama.com/) to enable this functionality.
